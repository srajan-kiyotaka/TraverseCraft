**TraverseCraft** is a ***versatile***, ***cross-platform*** library written in Python for creating *static*, *animated*, and *interactive visualizations*. Designed as a *robust simulation tool*, **TraverseCraft** allows users to build custom virtual worlds, populate them with agents, and observe real-time behaviors of various algorithms, including those in artificial intelligence (AI), reinforcement learning (RL), and machine learning (ML).

Powered by the ***[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter)*** library, **TraverseCraft** ensures *fast and responsive simulations*, making it ideal for students, educators, and researchers. Its intuitive framework enables users to easily generate, visualize, and interact with diverse world types and their respective agents, facilitating the study and development of advanced AI, RL, and ML algorithms.

Please visit the our official ***[website](https://harrionparrix.github.io/traversecraft/index.html)*** for more information.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** TraverseCraft operates seamlessly on various operating systems, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.
- **High Performance**: Built on the ***[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter)*** library for fast and responsive simulations.
- **Real-Time Algorithm Simulation:** Test and visualize the workings of your algorithms, such as search algorithms, in real time.
- **Dynamic Summaries and Heatmap:** Automatically generate summaries and heatmap to track agent movements and node visits dynamically.
- **Customizable World Generation:** Create and customize diverse worlds to suit your simulation needs.
- **Educational Utility:** Enhance the learning experience for students by providing a visual aid to understand algorithm workings, aiding both instructors and learners.
- **Research Application:** An invaluable tool for researchers in fields such as reinforcement learning, AI, ML, deep learning, and algorithm design.
- **User-Friendly Interface and Framework Flexibility:** Provides extensive customization options while remaining accessible to beginners.


## World Types

TraverseCraft currently supports the creation and simulation of three distinct world types:

| World Type  | Description                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grid World  |A customizable simulation of a grid environment for testing algorithms and agent navigation, with options for path, goal, and block states to mimic various grid scenarios.  |
| Tree World  | A visualized tree data structure, perfect for experimenting with various tree-based algorithms. It offers customizable weights, positions, and appearance for flexible and detailed tree like simulations.     |
| Graph World | A visualized graph data structure, perfect for experimenting with various graph-based algorithms. It offers customizable weights, edges, positions, and appearance for flexible and detailed graph like simulations.  |

Each world type is equipped with specialized agents designed to interact within these environments, enabling comprehensive testing and visualization of algorithms. For more information about each class and methods please refer to [API Reference](https://harrionparrix.github.io/traversecraft/references/world/World.html) section.
